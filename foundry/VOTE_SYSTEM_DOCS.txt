# Vote System Documentation

## Overview

The Vote System enables decentralized decision-making within crowdfunding projects. Contributors can vote on polls created by project owners, with their Contribution objects serving as proof of backing and voting eligibility.

---

## Core Concept

### Voting Rights
- **Who Can Vote**: Only contributors who have funded the project
- **Proof of Backing**: Contributors must present their Contribution object to vote
- **One Vote Per Person**: Each contributor can vote only once per poll
- **Multiple Polls**: Contributors can vote on multiple different polls

### Contribution as Access Token
The Contribution object serves dual purposes:
1. **Receipt**: Proof of financial backing
2. **Voting Token**: Enables participation in project governance

---

## vote_on_poll Function

### Function Signature

```move
public fun vote_on_poll(
    project: &mut Project,
    poll_id: u64,
    contribution: &Contribution,
    option_index: u64,
    ctx: &mut TxContext
)
```

### Parameters

1. **project**: `&mut Project`
   - Mutable reference to the Project containing the poll
   - Required to access and update the poll's state

2. **poll_id**: `u64`
   - Unique identifier of the poll to vote on
   - Matches the key in the project's polls table

3. **contribution**: `&Contribution`
   - Immutable reference to the voter's Contribution object
   - Serves as proof of backing and voting eligibility
   - Must belong to the same project as the poll

4. **option_index**: `u64`
   - Index of the voting option (0-based)
   - Must be within the valid range of poll options

5. **ctx**: `&mut TxContext`
   - Transaction context
   - Used to identify the caller (voter)

### Return Value

- **None** (mutates the Poll's state)
- Updates the vote count for the chosen option
- Registers the voter in the voters table

---

## Implementation Details

### Validation Checks

#### 1. Poll Existence
```move
assert!(table::contains(&project.polls, poll_id), EPollNotFound);
```
- Verifies the poll exists in the project
- Error: `EPollNotFound` (code 10)

#### 2. Contribution Validity
```move
let project_id = object::id(project);
assert!(contribution.project_id == project_id, EInvalidContribution);
```
- Ensures the Contribution is for this specific project
- Prevents cross-project voting
- Error: `EInvalidContribution` (code 9)

#### 3. Contribution Ownership
```move
assert!(contribution.backer_address == caller, EInvalidContribution);
```
- Verifies the caller owns the Contribution
- Prevents voting with someone else's Contribution
- Error: `EInvalidContribution` (code 9)

#### 4. Option Validation
```move
let options_count = vector::length(&poll.options);
assert!(option_index < options_count, EInvalidOption);
```
- Checks if the option index is within bounds
- Error: `EInvalidOption` (code 11)

#### 5. Double-Voting Prevention
```move
assert!(!table::contains(&poll.voters, caller), EAlreadyVoted);
```
- Checks if the caller has already voted
- Error: `EAlreadyVoted` (code 12)

### Vote Recording

#### 1. Increment Vote Count
```move
let current_votes = *table::borrow(&poll.votes, option_index);
let new_vote_count = current_votes + 1;
*table::borrow_mut(&mut poll.votes, option_index) = new_vote_count;
```
- Retrieves current vote count for the option
- Increments by 1
- Updates the votes table

#### 2. Register Voter
```move
table::add(&mut poll.voters, caller, true);
```
- Adds the voter's address to the voters table
- Marks them as having voted
- Prevents future double-voting

#### 3. Emit Event
```move
event::emit(VoteCast {
    project_id: object::id_to_address(&project_id),
    poll_id,
    voter: caller,
    option_index,
    new_vote_count,
});
```
- Emits VoteCast event for off-chain indexing
- Includes all relevant voting information

---

## VoteCast Event

### Structure
```move
public struct VoteCast has copy, drop {
    project_id: address,
    poll_id: u64,
    voter: address,
    option_index: u64,
    new_vote_count: u64,
}
```

### Fields
- **project_id**: Project containing the poll
- **poll_id**: Poll identifier
- **voter**: Address of the voter
- **option_index**: Which option was voted for
- **new_vote_count**: Updated total votes for that option

### Use Cases
- Off-chain indexing for analytics
- Real-time vote count updates in UI
- Audit trail for voting activity
- Notification systems

## Error Handling

### Error Constants

| Code | Name | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| 9 | EInvalidContribution | Contribution is not for this project or caller doesn't own it |
| 10 | EPollNotFound | Poll ID doesn't exist in the project |
| 11 | EInvalidOption | Option index is out of bounds |
| 12 | EAlreadyVoted | Voter has already voted on this poll |

### Error Scenarios

1. **Poll Not Found**
   - User tries to vote on non-existent poll ID
   - Possible causes: Incorrect poll ID, poll not created yet

2. **Invalid Contribution**
   - Contribution is for a different project
   - Caller doesn't own the Contribution
   - Possible causes: Using wrong Contribution object, malicious attempt

3. **Invalid Option**
   - Option index >= number of options
   - Possible causes: UI bug, malicious input

4. **Already Voted**
   - User attempts to vote twice on the same poll
   - Possible causes: UI allows duplicate submission, malicious attempt

---

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Basic Vote

```move
// Prerequisites:
// - Project created
// - User has funded the project (received Contribution)
// - Owner has created a poll

// Vote on poll 0, option 1
vote_on_poll(&mut project, 0, &contribution, 1, ctx);
```

### Example 2: Multiple Voters

```move
// Backer 1 votes for option 0
vote_on_poll(&mut project, poll_id, &contribution1, 0, ctx1);

// Backer 2 votes for option 1
vote_on_poll(&mut project, poll_id, &contribution2, 1, ctx2);

// Backer 3 votes for option 0
vote_on_poll(&mut project, poll_id, &contribution3, 0, ctx3);

// Result: Option 0 has 2 votes, Option 1 has 1 vote
```

### Example 3: Voting on Multiple Polls

```move
// Same contributor can vote on different polls
vote_on_poll(&mut project, 0, &contribution, 1, ctx); // Poll 0
vote_on_poll(&mut project, 1, &contribution, 0, ctx); // Poll 1
vote_on_poll(&mut project, 2, &contribution, 2, ctx); // Poll 2
```

## Security Considerations

### 1. Contribution as Proof
- Using Contribution object ensures only real backers can vote
- Prevents non-contributors from influencing decisions
- Creates stake-based governance

### 2. Double-Voting Prevention
- `voters` table tracks who has voted
- Address-based tracking (one vote per address)
- Immutable once recorded

### 3. Option Validation
- Prevents out-of-bounds access
- Ensures vote counts are accurate
- Protects against malicious input

### 4. Contribution Ownership
- Verifies caller owns the Contribution
- Prevents voting with stolen/borrowed Contributions
- Maintains vote integrity

### 5. Project Binding
- Contribution must be for the specific project
- Prevents cross-project vote manipulation
- Isolates governance per project

---

## Integration with Frontend

### Transaction Building

```typescript
// TypeScript/JavaScript example
import { Transaction } from '@mysten/sui/transactions';

const tx = new Transaction();

tx.moveCall({
  target: `${PACKAGE_ID}::foundry::vote_on_poll`,
  arguments: [
    tx.object(projectId),           // Project object
    tx.pure.u64(pollId),            // Poll ID
    tx.object(contributionId),       // Contribution object
    tx.pure.u64(optionIndex),       // Option to vote for
  ],
});

// Sign and execute
const result = await signAndExecuteTransaction({ transaction: tx });
```

### Event Listening

```typescript
// Listen for VoteCast events
const events = await suiClient.queryEvents({
  query: {
    MoveEventType: `${PACKAGE_ID}::foundry::VoteCast`,
  },
});

events.data.forEach((event) => {
  console.log(`Vote cast on poll ${event.parsedJson.poll_id}`);
  console.log(`Option ${event.parsedJson.option_index} now has ${event.parsedJson.new_vote_count} votes`);
});
```

### UI Components

```typescript
// React component example
function VoteButton({ projectId, pollId, contributionId, optionIndex }) {
  const { mutate: vote } = useSignAndExecuteTransaction();
  
  const handleVote = async () => {
    const tx = new Transaction();
    
    tx.moveCall({
      target: `${PACKAGE_ID}::foundry::vote_on_poll`,
      arguments: [
        tx.object(projectId),
        tx.pure.u64(pollId),
        tx.object(contributionId),
        tx.pure.u64(optionIndex),
      ],
    });
    
    await vote({ transaction: tx });
  };
  
  return <button onClick={handleVote}>Vote</button>;
}
```

## Best Practices

### For Project Owners

1. **Clear Questions**: Write clear, unambiguous poll questions
2. **Reasonable Options**: Provide 2-5 well-defined options
3. **Timing**: Create polls after significant funding
4. **Communication**: Explain polls to contributors

### For Contributors

1. **Read Carefully**: Understand the question and options
2. **Check Eligibility**: Ensure you have a Contribution object
3. **One Vote**: Remember you can only vote once per poll
4. **Stay Informed**: Follow project updates before voting

### For Developers

1. **Validate Input**: Check poll_id and option_index on frontend
2. **Handle Errors**: Provide clear error messages to users
3. **Real-time Updates**: Listen for VoteCast events
4. **State Management**: Track which polls user has voted on
